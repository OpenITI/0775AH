90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The book’s table of contents is not accurate. For
    example, in Vol 1 the chapter on the story of Adam (“باب ما ورد في خلق
    آدم عليه السلام”) continues until the story of the descendants of
    Ibrahim. Or in the second volume, the title “باب ذكر جماعة من أنبياء بني
    إسرائيل بعد داود وسليمان وقبل زكريا ويحيى عليهم السلام” also includes
    the stories of Zakariyya and Yahya! I made small corrections by
    separating the stories relevant to each prophet to make the table of
    contents more reasonable. Moreover, some titles in the text are missing
    in the book’s table of contents (I have tagged them; so, Editpro text is
    now more reliable than the PDF). 2- The main categorization of the book
    is chronological. So, from PageV09P413 onwards (which is the beginning
    of the government of the caliphs), I kept up this chronological
    categorization and I avoided categorizing the titles according to the
    reign of caliphs. It is not possible to enforce a dual categorization in
    the text. We must adhere to one specific categorization; and here, the
    chronological categorization is of priority (a lot of the information
    presented under each year is just obituaries and has nothing to do with
    the reign of the caliphs). 3- Most of the titles are repeated
    redundantly, once in brackets and once without them. I kept one of them
    (the one that seemed correct) and untagged the other one (but I didn’t
    delete the redundant title; since I am not allowed to delete anything).
    4- There is a part at the end of each year entitled “من توفي فيها من
    الأعيان” which includes obituaries. I have tagged the names under this
    section because they are part of structural annotation. There are also
    some other obituaries in other parts of the text. I didn’t tag them
    because they are inside the text without any specific title to separate
    them and could not be considered as part of structural annotation. 5-The
    title “[ما وقع فيها من الأحداث]” is copied in the beginning of each year
    (probably by the typist, because it does not exist in the PDF); but in
    many cases it is not a correct title (sometimes this first part is just
    an introduction and no event is mentioned at all). 6- I just categorize
    the text according to what can be inferred from the headers. A more
    accurate categorization might be possible if someone reads the whole
    text carefully. 7- NOTE ON “0774IbnKathir.Bidaya” FOLDER ON THE
    REPOSITORY: there are two other books in this folder entitled “السيرة
    النبوية” and “معجزات النبي”. These books are extracts from “البداية
    والنهاية” which are published separately by other publishers. I checked
    some parts of these texts. They were exactly the same as the original
    text.
