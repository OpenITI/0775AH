90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Jonas Köpsel; Cornelia Neubauer; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Annotated by Jonas Köpsel and Cornelia Neubauer,
    validated by Gowaart.  Text is fairly good quality, some minor issues
    noted by Jonas and Cornelia directly on GitHub readme file. Annotation
    has been done very well, Gowaart only did some minor cleaning up.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): All the header tags for Juz`s removed since they are
    not part of the structure, and the levelling moved up by one level. After the
    sections entitled “الألقاب والأنساب” the text returns to the rest of the name
    entries, but there is no title to signify this shift of subject. I had no choice
    but to insert blank second-level headers at the beginning of the name entries to
    show this return (otherwise the name would be considered subsections of
    alqāb/ansāb sections, which is incorrect). PARATEXT added. 2- in readme file,
    the annotators report problems in pagination.
      Further note: poetry now tagged by Gowaart.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
