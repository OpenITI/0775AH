90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text follows the printed edition closely, with only a few missing pages: 7:279, 8:48, 8:303-304, 9:331, 10:262-263. Additionally, a missing section on page 3:400; the numbers 6-19 which appear in the middle of the text replace a few paragraphs of writing in the printed edition. SPL replaced the missing pages except 10:262-263, which are poetry and thus did not OCR very well (an ongoing problem with the model). As poetry is unlikely to be a focus of CnC research, this was deemed acceptable.
